This Python program checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters, but possibly in a different order. The program uses an optimal O(n) solution by utilizing hash maps (dictionaries) to count the frequency of each character in the strings and compare them efficiently.

Features:
🚀 Optimal Performance: Runs in O(n) time complexity, ensuring it can handle large strings efficiently.

🧠 Efficient Algorithm: Uses a hash map to track character counts, making the solution both simple and effective.

🔍 Scalable & Reusable: Can be easily modified to work with other string manipulation tasks, including text analysis and cryptographic applications.
